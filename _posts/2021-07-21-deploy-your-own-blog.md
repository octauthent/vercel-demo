This website is a brief example of a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site that can be deployed with Vercel and zero configuration.

Deploy your own Jekyll project with Vercel:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/import/project?template=https://github.com/vercel/vercel/tree/main/examples/jekyll)

Then, sign it to [Octauthent](https://octauthent.com) if you need the password protection feature!

You can also read the [tutorial](https://octauthent.medium.com/password-protect-your-vercel-site-with-octauthent-1f79e37b1d91) I wrote on Medium
